# What Is Synadrive

Synadrive is my game that sits somewhere in between simracing and AI trainer sandbox.

## Where Synadrive Came From?

 The project started from a desire for a game where I can train my own AI to do something. And also, this project is the continuation of something I started in college, where I made a game about training an AI to drive on a 2D version of the Interlagos circuit.

## What is My Aim for Synadrive?

I want to achieve Assetto Corsa levels of realism while also having a fully fleshed and robust AI training feature.

## What is the Gameloop?

I plan there to be a few game modes, but the heart of the game will remain in training your AI to achieve the fastest times on the tracks in the game.
